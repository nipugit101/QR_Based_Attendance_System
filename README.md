  - The class teacher (admin) can log in using these credentials to access the system.

- **Admin Dashboard**: 
  - View the list of all registered students along with their attendance records.
  - Download the QR code generated daily, which can then be shared with the students.

- **QR Code Attendance**: 
  - Students receive the QR code shared by the teacher.
  - They scan the QR code to mark their attendance for the day.

## How It Works
