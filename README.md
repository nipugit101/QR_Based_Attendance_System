QR-Based Attendance System
Overview
Taking attendance manually is a time-consuming process, especially in large classrooms. This project addresses this issue by creating a web-based solution where attendance can be marked quickly and efficiently using QR codes. The system allows teachers to easily manage and track student attendance with minimal effort.

Features
Admin Dashboard: A dedicated admin page for the class teacher to manage student attendance.
QR Code Generation: The system generates a new QR code each day, which the admin can download and share with students.
Student Attendance: Students can scan the provided QR code to mark their attendance, which is automatically recorded in the system.
